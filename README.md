LineString additions have been added alongside our prior KML support. Location data possessing multiple points for one object can be viewed by point or LineString, such as Activity Segments, Waypoints, and Simplified Raw Paths.

## Downloading

Navigate to the Google Location History Data Parser Setup.exe above. Select "More file actions" on the right, shown by an "..." icon, and choose "Download".

When downloading, you may be met with a download issue requiring you to trust the application to open it. This is because the application is new and not commonly downloaded. Selecting "More actions" will allow you to "Keep" the file and complete the download. 

## Usage

You may also be required to take additional steps when running the tool the first time, through Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. In the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen select "More info" and "Run anyway" to launch the application the first time. 

## Parsing a Google Takeout Location History Export or Google Semantic Location History Warrant Return

Run the application, browse to either your input .zip file or your folder containing numerous .zip files (if your data is within several .zip files), browser to your output folder, and select "Process." Your Google data will be parsed into several CSV files, the original files will be exported for data validation, and an information .txt file will all be saved to your output location!
